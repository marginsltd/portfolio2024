            <p>The summer of 2020 was an interesting time to be alive. As we contented with our own mortality, we were also thinking about what distributed teams meant for the future of work.</p>
            <p>We wanted to create something completely different to usual council comms, yet still fulfil its function as public service design. As part of our design team, I also co-created and delivered the course in partnership with Outlandish. I provided remote 1-2-1 guidance on personal + business projects. We had lots of participants say they got in touch because social media posts caught their eye.  We had lots of great feedback from the learners and I found the whole experience incredibly rewarding. The course was oversubscribed and the council planned to introduce this to other boroughs.</p>

            <h3>A note on trends</h3>
            <p>One of the many reasons I find Graphic Design so rewarding is because it's always moving forwards (or backwards, in a knowing way). All graphic communication is in conversation with what's around, and what's come before. It's a good idea to keep an eye on trends&mdash;not to emulate (although that's no bad thing early on in one's career)&mdash;but to get a read on cultural zeitgeists.</p>
            <p>Opportunity for visual wit is lower in importance when creating this type of work. We felt we could get away with green on white legibility as they were not crucial to understanding what this poster is trying to tell viewers. This was also a good chance to push our company typeface a bit further (Calibre has great capitals).</p>

Chris has been a really good tutor for my learning: clear, patient, expert! Among other online courses experienced during the pandemic, I have to say that this was the only one with a value not only for my creative enjoyment but also for my job profile.</blockquote>
